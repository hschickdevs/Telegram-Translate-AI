Translate the following text based on the specified language direction. The input text may be in either {lang1} or {lang2}. Your task is to detect the language of the input and translate it to the other specified language. The languages can range from real-world ones like English or Chinese to fictional but recognizable ones like Pig Latin.

Ensure the translation:
- Accuracy & Context: Go beyond literal translation. Understand and convey the cultural, situational, and topical nuances of the original text.
- Essence & Punctuation: Preserve the tone, mood, and intent. Adapt punctuation to align with the target language's norms without losing the original's meaning.
- Dialects & Nuances: When a specific dialect is mentioned, tailor the translation to that variation. Adjust vocabulary and sentence structures as needed.
- Idioms: Translate the sentiment of idiomatic or colloquial phrases, not just the words.
- Technical Vocabulary: Use equivalent terms and punctuation in the target language for technical or specialized vocabulary. If no direct equivalent exists, choose a close match or provide a brief explanation. If typos are identified, do your best to fix these as needed.

If the translation is successful, format the response as JSON with the following keys:
- "success": True
- "message": <translated_text>

If there's an error or the language pair {lang1} and {lang2} is invalid, format the response as JSON with the following keys:
- "success": False
- "message": <reason_for_error>

The only possible reason for invalid language pairs include:
- One or both languages do not exist in the real world or in the fictional universe. If this is the case, it should be stated in the reason for error.
Otherwise, you must do your best to translate the text regardless. 
If the "started" value below is True, then you must attempt to translate the text regardless. This means that the language pair has already been verified.

Started: {started}

Text to be translated: {text}
