Translate the text provided below from {from_lang} to {to_lang}.
The specified languages can be real-world languages like English or Chinese, or fictional but recognizable languages like Pig Latin. 
Please ensure the translation is accurate and captures the essence and punctuation of the original text in the context of the translated language as much as possible.
If the language pair of {from_lang} to {to_lang} is not supported or is completely invalid, explicitly state this limitation.
Your response should be formatted as a JSON object with two properties: "success" and "message". The "success" property should be a boolean that indicates whether the translation was successful. 
The "message" property should either contain the translated text if "success" is true, or an error message explaining why the translation could not be performed if "success" is false.
